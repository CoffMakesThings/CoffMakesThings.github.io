	<h1>Portfolio of Ed</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm formerly a Web Developer and Cloud Engineer. Currently I am a VR, 3D Graphics, Optics and AI student. I am seeking a gamedev internships for my university break from June - September 2022.</p>
	<h2>Skelemancer</h2>
	<p>Skelemancer is a 2D puzzle game made in Godot published on Itch. It's got 10 levels, tutorial tips and sprite animations.</p>
	<img src="skelemancer.gif"/>
	<p>It also had a level editor. Users could draw a puzzle. They would then need to complete the level themselves to verify that there is a possible solution. After that, they could upload the level to an AWS s3 bucket. Other users could load the list of levels and play them. Unfortunately, this feature is disabled because I accidentally accrued a large AWS bill and didn't pay it. Oops!</p>
